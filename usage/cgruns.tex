\chapter{Preparing coarse-grained runs}
\label{sec:usage:cgrun}
\textbf{WARNING: This section describes experimental features. The exact names and options of the program might change in the near future.  The section is specific to \gromacs support, a generalization for other md packages is planned.}

\section{Generating a topology file for a coarse-grained run}
The mapping definition is close to a topology needed for a coarse grained run. To avoid redundant work, \prog{csg_gmxtopol} can be used to automatically generate a gromacs topology based on an atomistic reference system and a mapping file.

At the current state, \prog{csg_gmxtopol} can only generate the topology for the first molecule in the system. If more molecule types are present, a special tpr file has to be prepared. The program can be executed by
\begin{verbatim}
  csg_gmxtopol --top topol.tpr --cg map.xml --out cgtop
\end{verbatim}
which will create a file cgtop.top. This file includes the topology for the first molecule including definitions for atoms, bonds, angles and dihedrals. It can directly be used as topology in \gromacs , however the force field definitions (atom types, bond tyes, etc) still have to be added manually.

\section{TODO: here is planned (partially after first manual release)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item refining potential files (\votca output) to use in simulation package
\end{itemize}
