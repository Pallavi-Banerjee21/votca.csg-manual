	abstract = {An approach is presented to solve the reverse problem of statistical mechanics: reconstruction of interaction potentials from radial distribution functions. The method consists of the iterative adjustment of the interaction potential to known radial distribution functions using a Monte Carlo simulation technique and statistical-mechanics relations to connect deviations of canonical averages with Hamiltonian parameters. The method is applied to calculate the effective interaction potentials between the ions in aqueous NaCl solutions at two different concentrations. The reference ion-ion radial distribution functions, calculated in separate molecular dynamics simulations with water molecules, are reproduced in Monte Carlo simulations, using the effective interaction potentials for the hydrated ions. Application of the present method should provide an effective and economical way to simulate equilibrium properties for very large molecular systems (e.g., polyelectrolytes) in the presence of hydrated ions, as well as to offer an approach to reduce a complexity in studies of various associated and aggregated systems in solution.},

	abstract = {It is shown that data on the site-site pair correlation functions for a fluid of molecules can be used to derive a set of empirical site-site potential energy functions. These potential functions reproduce the fluid structure accurately but at the present time do not reproduce thermodynamic information on the fluid, such as the internal energy or pressure. The method works in an iterative manner, starting from a reference fluid in which only Lennard-Jones interactions are included, and generates, by Monte Carlo simulation, successive corrections to those potentials which eventually lead to the correct site-site pair correlation functions. Using this approach the structure of water as determined from neutron scattering experiments is compared to the structure of water obtained from the simple point charge extended (SPCE) model of water interactions. The empirical potentials derived from both experiment and SPCE water show qualitative similarities with the true SPCE potential, although there are quantitative differences. The simulation is driven by a set of potential energy functions, with equilibration of the energy of the distribution, and not, as in the reverse Monte Carlo method, by equilibrating the value of chi(2), which measures how closely the simulated site-site pair correlation functions fit a set of diffraction data. As a result the simulation proceeds on a true random walk and samples a wide range of possible molecular configurations.},

The effect of more realistically accounting for the excluded volume of the phenylene comonomeric units in the coarse-grained simulation is examined. The new treatment avoids artifacts arising from sphere-packing, which dominate the liquid structure and dynamics in the older scheme, leading to a significant improvement in the equilibration time, for systems run at the typical processing temperature of 570 K. However, we observe only a slight improvement (10(-4) eV/atom) in the equilibration of atomistically detailed samples that are inverse-mapped from the equilibrated coarse-grained configurations. Distributions in the atomistically resolved backbone bond and torsion angles are identical using the two schemes, as are computed liquid coherent scattering functions. This indicates that artifacts present at the coarsened level are effectively erased by equilibration at full-blown atomistic resolution, at least for systems with relatively short chains well above the glass transition temperature.},

The method was applied to derive effective nonpolarizable three-site force fields for liquid water at ambient conditions from Car-Parrinello MD simulations in the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr approximation to the electronic density functional theory. The force-matching procedure includes a fit of short-ranged nonbonded forces, bonded forces, and atomic partial charges. The various parameterizations of the water force field differ by an enforced smooth cut-off applied to the short-ranged interaction term. These were obtained by fitting to the trajectory and force data produced by Car-Parrinello MD simulations of systems of 32 and 64 H2O molecules. The new water force fields were developed assuming both flexible or rigid molecular geometry. The simulated structural and self-diffusion properties of liquid water using the fitted force fields are in close agreement with those observed in the underlying Car-Parrinello MD simulations. The resulting empirical models compare to experiment much better than many conventional simple point charge (SPC) models. The fitted potential is also shown to combine well with more sophisticated intramolecular potentials. Importantly, the computational cost of the new models is comparable to that for SPC-like potentials. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

The coarse graining of an interparticle force field is accomplished by the application of a force-matching method to the trajectories and forces obtained from the atomistic trajectory and force data for the CG sites of the targeted system. The CG sites can be associated with the centers of mass of atomic groups because of the simplicity in the evaluation of forces acting on these sites from the atomistic data. The resulting system is called a multiscale coarse-grained (MS-CG) representation. The MS-CG method for liquids is applied here to water and methanol. For both liquids one-site and two-site CG representations without an explicit treatment of the long-ranged electrostatics have been derived. In addition, for water a two-site model having the explicit long-ranged electrostatics has been developed. To improve the thermodynamic properties (e.g., pressure and density) for the MS-CG models, the constraint for the instantaneous virial was included into the force-match procedure. The performance of the resulting models was evaluated against the underlying atomistic simulations and experiment. In contrast with existing approaches for coarse graining of liquid systems, the MS-CG approach is general, relies only on the interatomic interactions in the reference atomistic system.

In the second part, we take a different look at coarse graining by analyzing conformations of molecules. This is done by the application of self-organizing maps, i.e., a neural network type approach. Such an approach can be used to guide the selection of the relevant degrees of freedom. Then, we discuss technical issues related to the popular dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. Importantly, the potentials derived using the inverse Monte Carlo method can be used together with the DPD thermostat. In the final part we focus on solvent-free modeling which offers a different route to coarse graining by integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with solvent.},

	abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models provide a computationally efficient method for rapidly investigating the long time- and length-scale processes that play a critical role in many important biological and soft matter processes. Recently, Izvekov and Voth introduced a new multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) method [J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 2469 (2005); J. Chem. Phys. 123, 134105 (2005)] for determining the effective interactions between CG sites using information from simulations of atomically detailed models. The present work develops a formal statistical mechanical framework for the MS-CG method and demonstrates that the variational principle underlying the method may, in principle, be employed to determine the many-body potential of mean force (PMF) that governs the equilibrium distribution of positions of the CG sites for the MS-CG models. A CG model that employs such a PMF as a ?potential energy function? will generate an equilibrium probability distribution of CG sites that is consistent with the atomically detailed model from which the PMF is derived. Consequently, the MS-CG method provides a formal multiscale bridge rigorously connecting the equilibrium ensembles generated with atomistic and CG models. The variational principle also suggests a class of practical algorithms for calculating approximations to this many-body PMF that are optimal. These algorithms use computer simulation data from the atomically detailed model. Finally, important generalizations of the MS-CG method are introduced for treating systems with rigid intramolecular constraints and for developing CG models whose equilibrium momentum distribution is consistent with that of an atomically detailed model. �2008 American Institute of Physics},

Phys. 123, 134105 (2005)] employs a variational principle to determine an interaction potential for a CG model from simulations of an atomically detailed model of the same system. The companion paper proved that, if no restrictions regarding the form of the CG interaction potential are introduced and if the equilibrium distribution of the atomistic model has been adequately sampled, then the MS-CG variational principle determines the exact many-body potential of mean force (PMF) governing the equilibrium distribution of CG sites generated by the atomistic model. In practice, though, CG force fields are not completely flexible, but only include particular types of interactions between CG sites, e.g., nonbonded forces between pairs of sites. If the CG force field depends linearly on the force field parameters, then the vector valued functions that relate the CG forces to these parameters determine a set of basis vectors that span a vector subspace of CG force fields. The companion paper introduced a distance metric for the vector space of CG force fields and proved that the MS-CG variational principle determines the CG force force field that is within that vector subspace and that is closest to the force field determined by the many-body PMF. The present paper applies the MS-CG variational principle for parametrizing molecular CG force fields and derives a linear least squares problem for the parameter set determining the optimal approximation to this many-body PMF. Linear systems of equations for these CG force field parameters are derived and analyzed in terms of equilibrium structural correlation functions. Numerical calculations for a one-site CG model of methanol and a molecular CG model of the EMIM^+/NO_3^- ionic liquid are provided to illustrate the method. �2008 American Institute of Physics},

The construction of an effective potential may be based on theoretical assumptions, on the application of fitting procedures on experimental data and on the simplification of complex molecular simulations. Recently, a force-matching method was elaborated to project the data of Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics simulations onto two-particle classical interactions ( Izvekov et al 2004 J. Chem. Phys. 120 10896). We have developed a potential-matching algorithm as a practical analogue of this force-matching method. The algorithm requires a large number of configurations (particle positions) and a single value of the potential energy for each configuration. We show the details of the algorithm and the test calculations on simple systems. The test calculation on water showed an example in which a similar structure was obtained for qualitatively different pair interactions. The application of the algorithm on reverse Monte Carlo configurations was tried as well.

We detected inconsistencies in a part of our calculations. We found that the coarse graining of potentials cannot be performed perfectly both for the structural and the thermodynamic data. For example, if one applies an inverse method with an input of the pair-correlation function, it provides energetics data for the configurations uniquely. These energetics data can be different from the desired ones obtained by all atom simulations, as occurred in the testing of our potential-matching method.},

As a test case, the approach is applied to atactic polystyrene (PS). First, a specific model for atactic PS is chosen. The bonded parameters in the coarse-grained force field, based on data obtained from atomistic simulations of isolated PS dimers, are chosen in a way which allows to differentiate between meso and racemic dyads. This approach in principle allows to study isotactic and syndiotactic melts as well. Nonbonded interactions between coarse-grained beads were chosen as purely repulsive. The proposed mesoscopic model reproduces both the local structure and the chain dimensions properly. An explicit time mapping is performed, based on the atomistic and CG mean-square displacements of short chains, demonstrating an effective speed up of about 3 orders of magnitude compared to brute force atomistic simulations. Finally the equilibrated coarse-grained chains are back mapped onto the atomistic systems. This opens new routes for obtaining well equilibrated high molecular weight polymeric systems and also providing very long dynamic trajectories at the atomistic level for these polymers.},

The coarse-grained model is designed such that it correctly captures the conformational. exibility of the molecules and reproduces the interaction between peptides in aqueous solution. In the present paper, we revisit this model and present a method to devise nonbonded interactions such that also the coarse-grained level maintains explicit solvent degrees of freedom. In this new approach we rely on a structure-based coarse graining methodology which preserves the solvation structure around the peptides in combination with a method to devise nonbonded potentials between peptide beads in a way that the peptide-peptide interaction in water is represented correctly and that results in the correct thermodynamic association behavior. The outlined coarse graining strategy provides us with two (one implicit-and one explicit-solvent) models that are well suited for multiscale-simulation and scale-bridging purposes. We show that this is a powerful tool to efficiently simulate long time-scale and large length-scale biomolecular processes such as peptide self-assembly. In combination with an efficient backmapping methodology we can obtain well-equilibrated atomistic structures of the resulting aggregates.},

In addition to the existing symmetric 5-site model, which has its origin in the ST2 potential, asymmetric 3- and 4-site descendants of TIPS potentials are introduced along with an extended 5-site model which incorporates a short-range repulsion between the like sites. The structure of the fluids defined by the primitive models has been investigated in detail by computing site-site correlation functions, both at high and low densities, and the angular distribution of particles engaged in hydrogen bonding. For completeness, the thermodynamic properties have also been computed. It transpires that the extended 5-site model, due to its enlarged range of the hydrogen bond interaction, clearly is much better than all the other models. It is able to reproduce even semi-quantitatively the structure of real water, and thus seems well suited to all potential applications involving water, including perturbation theories using the extended model as a reference fluid.},

If no approximations are made, then the MS-CG method yields a many-body multidimensional potential of mean force describing the interactions between CG sites. However, numerical applications of the MS-CG method typically employ a set of pair potentials to describe nonbonded interactions. The analogy between coarse-graining and the inverse problem of liquid-state theory clarifies the general significance of three-particle correlations for the development of such CG pair potentials. It is demonstrated that the MS-CG methodology incorporates critical three-body correlation effects and that, for isotropic homogeneous systems evolving under a central pair potential, the MS-CG equations are a discretized representation of the well-known Yvon-Born-Green equation. Numerical calculations validate the theory and illustrate the role of these structural correlations in the MS-CG method.},

The systems are studied in the fluid phase above the main transition temperature. The effective interactions for the CG model are extracted from atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations using the inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) technique, an approach similar to the one the authors used earlier to construct another CG bilayer model [T. Murtola , J. Chem. Phys. 121, 9156 (2004)]. Here, the authors improve their original CG model by employing a more accurate description of the molecular structure for the phospholipid molecules. Further, they include a thermodynamic constraint in the IMC procedure to yield area compressibilities in line with experimental data. The more realistic description of the molecular structure of phospholipids and a more accurate representation of the interaction between cholesterols and phospholipid tails are shown to improve the behavior of the model significantly. In particular, the new model predicts the formation of denser transient regions in a pure phospholipid system, a finding that the authors have verified through large scale atomistic simulations. They also find that the model predicts the formation of cholesterol-rich and cholesterol-poor domains at intermediate cholesterol concentrations, in agreement with the original model and the experimental phase diagram. However, the domains observed here are much more distinct compared to the previous model. Finally, the authors also explore the limitations of the model, discussing its advantages and disadvantages.

Here, a molecule with three-fold symmetry and alternating hydrophilic/hydrophobic side chains is synthesized and X-ray scattering is used to prove the formation of the desired helical microstructure. Time-resolved microwave-conductivity measurements show that the material has indeed a very high mobility, 0 : 2 cm(2) V(-1)s(-1). The assemblies of molecules are simulated using molecular dynamics, confirming the model deduced from X-ray scattering. The simulated structures, together with quantum-chemical techniques, prove that mobility is still limited by structural defects and that a defect-free assembly could lead to mobilities in excess of 10 cm(2) V(-1)s(-1).},

This leads to a second friction parameter for tuning the transport properties of the system. Numerical simulations of a simple Lennard-Jones fluid and liquid water demonstrate a very sensitive behaviour of the transport properties, e. g., viscosity, on the strength of the new friction parameter. We envisage that the new thermostat will be very useful for the coarse-grained and adaptive resolution simulations of soft matter, where the diffusion constants and viscosities of the coarse-grained models are typically too high/low, respectively, compared to all-atom simulations.},

By employing a suitably coarse-grained model, which still contains the essentials of the BPA-PC structure, simulation times compared to atomistic simulations could be extended by several orders of magnitude, reaching well into the characteristic experimental regime. We find that a recently developed topological entanglement analysis compares well with a direct determination of the modulus from simulations as with experiments on well-characterized samples. This confirms the extraordinarily small value of the entanglement molecular weight on M-e between 1200 and 1400 corresponding to N-e close to 5.},

Although by construction these effective potentials correctly represent the isothermal compressibility of TIP4P-Ew water, they do not accurately resolve other thermodynamic properties such as the virial pressure, the internal energy, or thermodynamic anomalies. Because at a given state point the pair potential that reproduces the pair structure is unique, we have therefore explicitly demonstrated that it is impossible to simultaneously represent the pair structure and several key equilibrium thermodynamic properties of water with state-point dependent radially symmetric pair potentials. We argue that such representability problems are related to, but different from, more widely acknowledged transferability problems and discuss in detail the implications this has for the modeling of water and other liquids by coarse-grained potentials. Nevertheless, regardless of thermodynamic inconsistencies, the state-point dependent effective potentials for water do generate structural and dynamical anomalies.

Each amino acid of the protein is represented by two coarse-grained beads, one for the backbone (identical for all residues) and one for the side-chain (which differs depending on the residue type). The coarse-graining reduces the system size about 10-fold and allows integration time steps of 25-50 fs. The model is applied to simulations of discoidal high-density lipoprotein particles involving water, lipids, and two primarily helical proteins. These particles are an ideal test system for the extension of coarse-grained models. Our model proved to be reliable in maintaining the shape of preassembled particles and in reproducing the overall structural features of high-density lipoproteins accurately. Microsecond simulations of lipoprotein assembly revealed the formation of a protein-lipid complex in which two proteins are attached to either side of a discoidal lipid bilayer.},
